<h1>Non-technical Executive Summary</h1>
<p>In Ontario and Saskatchewan, people more often than not find themselves tired and unproductive under DST. The amount of hours that people want to sleep is not affected by the prescence of the DST system.</p>
</div>
<div id="introduction" class="section level1">
<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>This survey seeks to determine the effects of Daylight Saving Time policy on the
population and their respective opinions on the subject. Which will aid the Conservative Party’s decision-making on whether or not DST should be kept. To clarify, Day Light Saving time is where on two days of the year we shift the clock forward one hour, and later backwards one hour. The original purpose of this is to make more use out of daytime during the summer months, as it moves one hour of daylight in the morning to the evening.</p>
<p>In this report, the data is gathered with an online form targeting the populations of Saskatchewan and Ontario. These two provinces are chosen because one uses DST (Ontario), and the other doesn’t (Saskatchewan). However, Saskatchewan is <em>always</em> on DST. Meaning that the time zone for Saskatchewan should be Mountain Time Zone (GST -7:00), but it is using Central Standard Time (GST -6:00).</p>

<div id="survey-methodology" class="section level1">
<h1>Survey Methodology</h1>
<p>The data of this report is collected online through Google Forms, it seeks to compare two distinctly different provinces in terms of DST: Saskatchewan and Ontario, and its resident’s opinion on the matter. The reason for this is that we want to have two independent groups to compare.</p>
<p>We chose (relatively) major cities that are in the southern parts of their respective provinces, as shown below. These cities share similar latitudes and therefore should have similar hours of daylight (Not factoring weather).</p>
<p>Latitude of Cities (In Degrees North):</p>
<p>Ontario Cities:</p>
<ul>
<li>Windsor: 42</li>
<li>Toronto: 43</li>
<li>Sarnia: 42</li>
<li>Ottawa: 45</li>
<li>Kingston: 44</li>
<li>Thunder Bay: 48</li>
</ul>
<p>Saskatchewan Cities:</p>
<ul>
<li>Saskatoon: 52</li>
<li>Regina: 50</li>
<li>Timmins: 48</li>
<li>Uranium City: 59</li>
</ul>
<p>We are interested in the following information:</p>
<ul>
<li>Functionality of life</li>
<li>Opinion on DST (Positive of Negative)</li>
</ul>
<p>Where the functionality is determined by asking a series of questions on their sleeping quality, which is what we assumed to be a big factor. On the other hand, opinions about the DST is presented as whether or not people think that they are more irritable or less able to think while DST system is in place. There are multiple survey questions regarding these so that we can get a lower error.</p>
<p>Since we are basing most of the data on sleeping habits, we will not consider anyone with sleeping conditions. The first question of the survey is designed so that this issue is addressed.</p>
</div>
<div id="data" class="section level1">
<h1>Data</h1>
<p>The data is randomly generated and sampled with the following assumptions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Only 0.2 % of the target population responded.
Average duration of sleep 9.5 hours and standard deviation 1.7 hours</li>
<li>Small percentage of the target audience completed the survey</li>
<li>Equal likelihood that people within a specific region say they live nearest to a given city (eg, people who live in Eastern Ontario are just as likely to say they live near Kingston as they are to live near Ottawa)</li>
<li>Vast majority (~85%) of people agreed they can’t get to sleep during daylight
savings time</li>
<li>People in Saskatchewan still knows what DST feels like, even though they do not currently use DST.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Discussion</h1>
<p>Toronto:<br />
mean: 9.5040512 hours, standard deviation: 1.5168929 hours<br />
Ottawa:<br />
mean: 9.4674077 hours, standard deviation: 1.4941763 hours<br />
Saskatchewan:<br />
mean: 9.5205714 hours, standard deviation: 1.5426172 hours</p>
<p>The mean is calculate using the following function:</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(\mu = \frac{\sum h}{n}\)</span></p>
<p>Where the numerator <span class="math inline">\(\sum h\)</span> represents the sum of all the hours combined, and the denominator <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> represents the total number of answers. <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span> represents the mean.</p>
<p>The standard deviation is calculated using the following function:</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(\sigma = \sqrt{\frac{\sum(x_i - \mu)^2}{N}}\)</span></p>
<p>Where the numerator <span class="math inline">\(\sum(x_i - \mu)^2\)</span> is the sum of each input of hours minus the mean all squared, and the denominator <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> is the total number of participants. This calculates what proportion of people have the similar sleeping schedules. A standard deviation of 1.5168929 hours for Toronto, for example, meant that 68.2 % of people have preferred sleeping time of 7.9871583 - 11.0209441 hours. Which is the mean plus or minus one standard deviation.</p>
<p>As shown above, the three major cities across both provinces have people following a similar normal distribution curve. With just over half of the people for both provinces have opinions against DST, of which about a quarter are neutral.</p>
<p>This survey is purposefully kept short, with only 7 simple questions of multiple choice, and one simple numerical question (how many hours of sleep do you need?), this aims to reduce the chance of people randomly selecting the answers due to boredom/lack of knowledge.</p>
<p>There are several factors that we can not account for with this survey. We can only determine who have poor opinion of DST, but not who likes DST, due to the nature of the survey questions. Since the people who answered “Neutral” can swing either way. There are certain inherent inaccuracies, since there might be people who lived in the northern part of the province and are more affected by daylight shift, but are not accounted for withe the choice of nearest city mostly being in the southern part of either provinces.</p>
</div>
<div id="results" class="section level1">
<h1>Results</h1>
<p>From the discussion, we can see that it is likely that most people do not have a positive outlook on DST. Then, it will be another factor to consider regarding the current policy on DST in Ontario.</p>
