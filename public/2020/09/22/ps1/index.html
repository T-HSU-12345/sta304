<h1>Abstract</h1>
<p>Using data from the 2019 Canadian Elections Study, three different questions about the economy asd given to people of different employment statuses (Students, Retired, Part Time, Full Time, Unemployed, and Disabled), and their opinions are compared. The data is then organized with the goal to see if there will be major differences in opinion between people of different employment status. It seems that people tend to not think the economy is better, and that unemployed/disabled people tend to think that the economy is worse off in general.</p>

<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>Is the Canadian economy in recession? I am not the expert on this subject. However, the Canadian Election Survey have collected information from 37822 people about their opinion, and I can organize their opinions to get a general idea as to what people THINK about the economy. The survey contains a myriad of questions such as employment status, religion, and income. This report looks at how might employment status affect the people’s opinion on how well the economy is doing.</p>
<p>There are three sections of the survey that will be compared, and they are:</p>
<ul>
<li>econ_retro: How people felt the economy have been in the past year.</li>
<li>econ_fed: If people think that the government have made an impact on the economy - whether it is positive or negative.</li>
<li>econ_self: How did people feel the effects of the government policies economically.</li>
</ul>
<p>Through the exploration of data, I found that unemployed and disabled people are more likely, according to this survey, to view the economy to be worse. Though a significant portion of them still think that there are no significant differences. Most importantly, only a minority in any group think that the economy is getting better.</p>
<p>This is only a preliminary analysis of the data, and no statistical model have been fitted to match the data. Mainly because the study is done on categorical data with only four different choices. Which means that fitting a statistical model is an improvement that can be made, and of course, a weakness in itself also. Regardless, another possible area that can be explored is other factors that may affect people’s opinion on the economy.</p>

<h1>Data</h1>
<p>Of 37822 people, 2456 of them did not fill in the data and therefore are not considered as part of the following graphs. In the survey, the students are split into Students and Students with Pay, but they are combined in this report as simply “Student”.</p>
